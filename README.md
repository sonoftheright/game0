### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for the pieces left behind by our frantic learning process! We 
will continue to deface this repository with drab little programs until our minds 
are hardened and our knowledge vast in the realms of syntax, design, and algorithmic 
purity! Be wary, all ye who run any .exe here!

Seriously, though: we're going to be learning how to code a game the way an ocelot 
learns to swim in treacle: by wading in, getting dirty, and not being afraid to get 
the heck out, rinse it all off, and start over again when we've gone far enough to
know the way we came is closer to our goal than the way we're headed.

### How do I get set up? ###

If you're here to learn, then look at the code (running programs is for chumps!). 
Maybe even look into past revisions of the code and see what brought us here. But
whatever you do, keep in mind that this is more of a sandbox than an organized and
professional workspace!

### Contribution guidelines ###

If you're here to learn, then make improvements to the already existing code!
Individual files will outline their individual goals (ideally) and running objectives
(probably), so don't be afraid to - again - look under the hood and determine purpose 
by gazing at things for a while until they make some semblance of sense. 

### Who do I talk to? ###

My name's Ben. This is my project to help get some potential myself and a few team
members in sync, coding efficiently and effectively, and moving towards the day when 
we can all efficiently code our own portions of the project independently in such a
way that allows the project to be sustainable, improvable, and readable to new people
hoping to get in on the action (and maybe help us out a bit in the future).
