Welcome! Time to learn.

### What is this repository for? ###

Version: 0.0.0000

This repository is for the pieces left behind by our frantic learning process! 
We will continue to deface this repository with drab little programs until our 
minds are hardened and our knowledge vast in the realms of syntax, design, and
algorithmic purity! Be wary, all ye who run any .exe here!

### How do I get set up? ###

If you're here to learn, then look at the code (running programs is for chumps!).
If you're here to see what we're making, don't bother! This is a workspace!

### Contribution guidelines ###

If you're here to learn, then make improvements to the already existing code!
Individual files will outline their individual goals and running objectives, so 
don't be afraid to - again - look under the hood and determine purpose by gazing at
things for a while until they make some semblance of sense. 

### Who do I talk to? ###

My name's Ben. This is my project to help get some potential team members up to speed,
coding efficiently and effectively, and moving towards the day when we can all be a)
working on separate portions/modules of the same project effectively and b) doing so 
in a sustainable, well-documented, and forward-thinking way.
