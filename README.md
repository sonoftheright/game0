### What is this? ###

game0 is my attempt to teach myself and learn more about game design, game engine architecture, long term project involvement, and programming in C++ in general. It's taken me years to realize and resolve to fulfill a lifelong dream of mine: to create games that I have always wanted to play, and to do so from scratch, by hand, without a whole lot of fuss, and without regrets. 

My personal philosophy on games - or, more accurately, interactive simulations - has always nagged at me in the back of my mind as I scoured the increasingly varied and lengthy catalog of games available to the public these days. No one seems to want to answer the questions I have about the capabilities of games to express certain possibilities through simulation; capabilities such as experimentation in AI and politics, economics, and larger, self-organizing, societal hierarchies built on simple anthropological relationships on the most basic level. Simulations of power dynamics from a one-to-one relationship to massive power hierarchies and the dynamics of inter-group reactions and relationships. What about morality, guilt, and remorse in NPC interactions? What about flexible frameworks for AI to simulate differing preferences, express intent and perform actions based on levels of apathy and empathy, or allow political ideologies, such as prioritizing freedom and security, to shape and form deeper goals and overriding principles underlying fulfillment-seeking behavior?

On the surface, so much of this seems far too complicated, but, as with all software simulations, it just needs the proper framework to represent it. And that's what I'd like to work on accomplishing. 

The Sims - as well as the other simulation games created by Maxis - opened a door into what games could and should be capable of expressing through basic simulation of NPC need hierarchies. Unfortunately, most of the innovation that made the Sims so fresh and exciting has long been left to stagnate, and the franchise has been converted into a cash cow that revealed itself to be more concerned with roleplay than simulation and content creation marketplace interactions than actual creative inquiry into simulations of AI sociological interaction/need prioritization and realization. 

A few other games have come close to expressing deeper forays into that arena, including, intruigingly, Prison Architect, which tracks needs and fulfillment scales across an entire prison population, allowing for a devolution into riotous anarchy when the needs of prisoners aren't tended to properly. But while these implementations are always intruiging in their differing contexts, it becomes simple mundane to see the same mechanics being used to inject games with the same kind of group-consciousness/mob mentality dynamic structure. The novelty is wearing thin. 

So, my first steps in this project will not be to simulate the above, but to create a solid engine foundation for an extensible behavioral simulation system that is both widely editable as well as widely variable in terms of its potential expressions in individually generated entities. Generation of such entities becomes the most interesting when individual trait variety makes overall relational interactions less than predictable and even, at times, hilariously inaccurate or just silly. 

Given the above, my goal is not just to create a game or a simulation: my goal is to make an interactive and modifiable tool for users to play in a sandbox of AI behavioral simulation mayhem, where the dynamics/weight distribution variables, the behavioral effects, and even flowcharts for governing behavioral outcomes would be editable and scriptable in real time by the users of this engine. 

But this is getting way, way ahead of ourselves. To see the current status of the project, check out my todo.md file. To see what's planned for the future, read farther down on the todo.md file. If you're curious as to what my current random engine architecture brainstorms are looking like, check out the architecturalbrainstorm.md file. 

The current state of the project is tiny compared to my hopes and dreams for it, but, in time, things will and are moving forward.
