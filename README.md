### What is this? ###

game0 is my attempt to teach myself and learn more about game design, game engine architecture, long term project involvement, and programming in C++ in general. It's taken me years to realize and resolve to fulfill a lifelong dream of mine: to create games that I have always wanted to play, and to do so from scratch, by hand, without a whole lot of fuss, and without regrets. 

My personal philosophy on games - or, more accurately, interactive simulations - has always nagged at me in the back of my mind as I scoured the increasingly varied and lengthy catalog of games available to the public these days. No one seems to want to answer the questions I have about the capabilities of games to express certain possibilities through simulation; capabilities such as experimentation in AI and politics, economics, and larger, self-organizing, societal hierarchies built on simple anthropological relationships on the most basic level. Simulations of power dynamics from a one-to-one relationship to massive power hierarchies and the dynamics of inter-group reactions and relationships. What about morality, guilt, and remorse in NPC interactions? What about flexible frameworks for AI to simulate differing preferences, express intent and perform actions based on levels of apathy and empathy, or allow political ideologies, such as prioritizing freedom and security, to shape and form deeper goals and overriding principles underlying fulfillment-seeking behavior?

On the surface, so much of this seems far too complicated, but, as with all software simulations, it just needs the proper framework to represent it. And that's what I'd like to work on accomplishing. 

The Sims - as well as the other simulation games created by Maxis - opened a door into what games could and should be capable of expressing through basic simulation of NPC need hierarchies. Unfortunately, most of the innovation that made the Sims so fresh and exciting has long been left to stagnate, and the franchise has been converted into a cash cow that revealed itself to be more concerned with roleplay than simulation and content creation marketplace interactions than actual creative inquiry into simulations of AI sociological interaction/need prioritization and realization. 

A few other games have come close to expressing deeper forays into that arena, including, intruigingly, Prison Architect, which tracks needs and fulfillment scales across an entire prison population, allowing for a devolution into riotous anarchy when the needs of prisoners aren't tended to properly.

Despite this, I feel that the scope of the possibilities in this area of inquiry is too large not to take a crack at. It's high time someone gave it a try, and high time I learned how to make such an idea work.
